            From being the people's President to spearheading the development of
            the most significant Indian missiles , late President Dr APJ Abdul
            Kalam has contributed to the development of the country in different
            spheres. <br /><br />
            As an aerospace scientist, Kalam worked with India's two major space
            research organisations - Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
            <br /><br />
            While, his work in the development and operationalisation of
            Indigenous guided missiles - AGNI and PRITHVI - earned him the title
            of the 'Missile Man of India,' there are many more ways in which
            Kalam has helped India in the division of science and technology.

                  Launch Vehicle -
                </b>

                Back in 1980s, when India had hardly dreamt of having its
                indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV), Dr Kalam's over
                10-year-long hard work as the project director for the
                development of the indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle at ISRO
                led to the ground-breaking scientific development. It was in
                July 1980, that India's SLV-III successfully deployed the Rohini
                satellite in the near-Earth orbit leading to the country
                becoming a member of the exclusive Space Club.

                  >Directed projects for the development of ballistic
                  missiles</b
                >
                - Kalam also headed the projects Devil and Valiant which had the
                aim of developing ballistic missiles using the technology behind
                the successful SLV program. Under mission Kalam with other
                projects, members developed many missiles including AGNI which
                is an intermediate-range ballistic missile and PRITHVI which is
                a surface-to-surface missile.

                <b>Headed multiple nuclear tests </b>- Serving as the Chief
                Scientific Adviser to the then Prime Minister, Kalam played a
                major role in heading the Pokhran-II nuclear testing leading to
                him being known as the best nuclear scientist of the country at
                that time. The nuclear testing under the supervision of Kalam
                during the period of July 1992 to December 1999 made India a
                nuclear-armed state.

                <b>He worked in making healthcare accessible to all </b> -
                Working jointly with cardiologist Soma Raju, the late President
                developed a cost-effective coronary stent 'Kalam-Raju Stent'
                which helped in making healthcare accessible to all.

                <b>Developed the rugged 'Kalam-Raju tablet' </b> - The duo of
                Kalam and Soma Raju later in 2012 designed a rugged tablet
                computer for better health care administration in the rural
                pockets of the country. They termed it the 'Kalam-Raju tablet.'

                For his work in the stream of science and politics, the 11th
                President was also awarded India's highest civilian honour or
                the Bharat Ratna. <br /><br />
                Kalam breathed his last on July 27, 2015, while delivering a
                lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong when he
                collapsed and died from a cardiac arrest.
